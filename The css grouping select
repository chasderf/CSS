The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions
Look at the following CSS code (the H1, h2, and p element shave the same style definitions)
H1 {
Text-align: center;
color:red;
}
H2 {
Text-align:center;
Color:red;
}
P {
Text-align:center;
Color:red;
}
It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code

To group selectors, seerate each selector with a comma
Ideally::
H1, h2, p {
Text-align:center;
Color: red;
}
