The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character followed by the class name
.center {
Text-align: center;
Color-red;
}
In this example only <p> elements with class = “center” will be red and center-aligned
P.center {
Text-align:center;
Color: red;
}
HTML elements can also refer to more than one class
<p class = “center large”> this paragraph refers to two classes. </p>
