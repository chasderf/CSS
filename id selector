The CSS id selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element
The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id = “para1”:
#para1 {
Text-align: center
Color:red;
}
