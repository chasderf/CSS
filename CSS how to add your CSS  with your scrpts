When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information
in the style sheet

Three ways to insert CSS
External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS

External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element,
inside the head section

style sheet can be written by any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension

An external style sheet can be written by any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags
Here is how the “my style.css” file looks:

Note: do not add a space between the property value and the unit
Incorect (space): margin - left: 20px;
Correct (no space): margin-left: 20px;

Int3ernal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style
The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section

Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain
any CSS property

NOTE: an inline style loses many of the advance ages of a style sheet ( by mixing content with
presentation ) use this method sparingly

Multple style sheets
If some properties have been defines for the same selector (element) in different style sheet, the
value from the last read style sheet will be used

Cascading order
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element>
All styles in a page will “cascade” into a new “virtual” style sheet by the follwoing rules, where
number one has the highest priority
Inline style (inside an HTML element)
External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
Browser default

So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser
defaults
